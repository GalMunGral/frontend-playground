  "description": "It's my understanding that *UI programming is all about synchronizing UI state with the underlying application state that is inaccessible to users*. In other words, it's about managing state dependencies: Whenever a variable changes value, all other variables depending on it need to be re-evaluated. However, under the imperative paradigm, where this management is carried out manually, the dependency relations are hidden in the control flows. As the dependencies become increasingly complex, I believe it's best to *manage the dependency relations explicitly and delegate the actual updating to a generic logic that simply propagates state changes along the directed edges of the (conceptual) dependency graph*. ## Architecture Each DOM node is attached to a `DOMElement` instance that looks like this: ```javascript {   props: { p1: v1, p2: v2 },   ownerTable: {     name1: DOMElement,     name2: DOMElement   },   dependentTable: {     someProp: [{       node: DOMElement,       object: HTMLElement || HTMLElement.style,       attribute: innerHTML || value || className || someCSSProperty       value: (params) => v,       dependencies: [names]     }]   },   element: HTMLElement,   innerHTML: {     value: (params) => v,     dependencies: [names]   },   value: {     value: (params) => v,     dependencies: [names]   },   class: {     value: (params) => v,     dependencies: [names]   },   style: {     someCSSProperty: {       value: (params) => v,       dependencies: [names]     }   }   } ```",
